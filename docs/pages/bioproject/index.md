## When to create an NCBI BioProject

NCBI recommends organizing BioProjects in the most appropriate way for your research effort. For public health laboratories, funding frequently dictates which BioProject data should be submitted to. In absence of guidance from a funding source, consider organizing your data into different BioProjects based on surveillance/research project, epidemiological investigation, or funding source. BioProjects can be tagged with a set of funding sources (NIH funding sources get special treatment & cross linking), sequencing goals, and organism scope.

## Umbrella BioProjects

Umbrella BioProjects are collections of multiple primary submission BioProjects that are part of a shared initiative, collaboration or funding source. They are administrative in nature and are not used for primary data submission. Umbrella BioProjects can be created by designating the "Project type" as "Umbrella project" in the BioProject submission portal. To add a BioProject to an already established Umbrella project, email BioProjecthelp@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with details about which project(s) you want to cluster and why.
