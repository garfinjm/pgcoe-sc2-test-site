## When to create an NCBI BioProject

NCBI recommends organizing BioProjects in [the most appropriate way for your research effort](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/docs/faq/%23under-what-circumstances-is-it-n). For public health laboratories, funding frequently dictates which BioProject data should be submitted under. In the absence of guidance from a funding source, consider organizing your data into different BioProjects based on surveillance/research project, epidemiological investigation, or funding source. BioProjects can vary substantailly in scope and number of samples, from [a single sample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/389728) to [hundreds of thousands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/230403) or more samples. BioProjects can be tagged with a set of funding sources (NIH funding sources get special treatment & cross linking), sequencing goals, and organism scope.

The NCBI "[BioProject Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/docs/faq/)" page contains answers to many common questions reguarding when to create a bioproject and what options to select during setup.

## Umbrella BioProjects

Umbrella BioProjects are collections of primary submission BioProjects that are part of a shared initiative, collaboration or funding source (for example the [CDC COVID-19 Outbreak](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/615625) BioProject). They are administrative in nature and are not used for primary data submission. Umbrella BioProjects can be created by designating the `Project type` as `Umbrella project` in the BioProject submission portal. To add a BioProject to an already established Umbrella project, email BioProjecthelp@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with details about which project(s) you want to cluster and why.
